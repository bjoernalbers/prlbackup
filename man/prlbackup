A working installation of Parallels Server is required\. \. \.P prlbackup was tested under Parallels Server for Mac 4\.0 (PSfM)\. \. \.SH "OPTIONS" \. \.TP \efB\-h\efR, \efB\-\-help\efR Display a short help (same as when called without any options at all)\. \. \.TP \efB\-a\efR, \efB\-\-all\efR Backup all virtual machines which are registered in Parallels Server\. \. \.TP \efB\-e\efR, \efB\-\-exclude\efR Backup all but the given virtual machines (only applicable in combination with option \efB\-\-all\efR!)\. \. \.TP \efB\-f\efR, \efB\-\-full\efR Create full backups (by default incremental backups are created)\.

This cleanup action will be executed for each VM right after creating the corresponding backup but only if the backup was successfully created\. Incremental backups are automatically deleted by Parallels Server when their full backup is deleted\. \. \.SH "EXAMPLES" Display short help: \. \.IP "" 4 \. \.nf
