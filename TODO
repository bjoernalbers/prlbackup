# exceptions should go to stderr | normal logging stuff should go to stdout (why? )
# flush, because we are logging
# delete old project (parallels-backup)
# how to layout the libs and stuff (class and module naming, etc.)?
# what output should go into a log format?
# log format should be human-readable by default but also easily parsable (backup RESULT by VM, possible with backup-id / vmname vmid)
