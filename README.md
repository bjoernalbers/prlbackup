prlbackup
=========

An awesome command-line app to backup Virtual Machines from Parallels Server.

Description
-----------

prlbackup simplifies the backup of one or multiple Virtual Machines running
on Parallels Server by stoping VMs during backup and deleting old backups on demand.
A working installation of Parallels Server is required.

Installation
------------

	gem install prlbackup

Usage
-----

Take a look at `gem man prlbackup` or see the online documenation.

Caveats
-------

prlbackup was tested under Parallels Server for Mac 4.0 (PSfM).

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, gemspec or History.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
